# **`@baseapp-frontend/design-system`**

## **Overview**

This package defines our design system configuration (e.g. color pallete, typography, spacings, etc). It also shares reusable components that make up the design system as a whole.

## **What is in here?**

This package contains essential BaseApp modules such as `comments`, `notifications`, `messages` and `navigations`. It also includes Storybook, a tool for component documentation and visualization. To run the Storybook locally, run the following command:

```bash
# at root level

pnpm storybook --filter @baseapp-frontend/design-system
```
