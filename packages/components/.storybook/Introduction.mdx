# BaseApp Packages Storybook

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is an open-source tool for building and documenting UI components and pages in isolation. It allows developers to create, test, and document components without needing to rely on the backend or navigate through the entire application. This approach enhances the speed and reliability of UI development by enabling component-focused workflows.

## Purpose of This Storybook

The Storybook for **BaseApp Components Package** serves as a centralized resource for developers, designers or any interested person to:

- **Explore Components**: View, test, and understand the various UI components and pages available in the project.
- **Document Features**: Provide comprehensive documentation for each component and page, ensuring that their purpose, usage, and customization options are clear to all team members.
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Storybook enables both developers and non-developers to review and discuss UI elements, fostering better communication across the team.

## How to Use This Storybook

1. **Browse Components and Pages**: Navigate through the sidebar to explore the different components and pages. Each item has a detailed documentation section outlining its purpose, props, and usage examples.
2. **Check Component States**: Each component has multiple stories showcasing its different states, such as default, loading, or error configurations. This provides a comprehensive view of how each component behaves in various scenarios.
3. **View Documentation**: Each component and page includes an MDX documentation file with information on usage, props, and additional notes. This documentation is intended to be a reference for all team members, from developers to designers.

## Contribution and Maintenance

For consistency, please follow the documentation standards when adding new components or updating existing ones. You can refer to our [Tettra page](https://app.tettra.co/teams/TSL/pages/frontend-documentation) for detailed guidelines on writing stories and MDX documentation.
