# Component Documentation

## ProfileComponent

- **Purpose**: The `ProfileComponent` displays a detailed view of a user profile, including their profile picture, name, biography, followers count, and additional actions like "Follow," "Block," or "Edit Profile" (when applicable).

- **Expected Behavior**:  
  The component should render all profile-related information and actions based on the props provided. It also supports:
  - Conditional rendering of the "Edit Profile" button if the `currentProfileId` matches the profile's `id`.
  - Feedback when the "Share Profile" button is clicked.
  - Handling edge cases, such as missing profile data or API errors.

---

## Use Cases

- **Current Usage**: The `ProfileComponent` is used in the `ProfilePage` to provide a detailed view of a user's profile.

---

## Props

- **profile** (Relay Fragment Reference): The profile data to be displayed. This includes the user's name, biography, images, and other information about the profile.

- **currentProfileId** (string): The ID of the currently logged-in user's profile. Used to determine if the "Edit Profile" button should be displayed.

---

## Notes

- **Related Components**:
  - `BlockButtonWithDialog`: Used within the `ProfileComponent` for blocking or unblocking profiles.
  - `FollowToggleButton`: Allows toggling the follow/unfollow state for the profile.
