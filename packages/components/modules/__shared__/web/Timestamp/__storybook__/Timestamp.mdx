# Component Documentation

## Timestamp

- **Purpose**: A component that displays formatted time information from an ISO date string, commonly used to show timestamps in a consistent format throughout the application.
- **Expected Behavior**: Takes an ISO date string as input and renders it in a standardized time format using the Typography component. The time is displayed in a subtle, secondary text color.

## Use Cases

- **Current Usage**: Used in message groups to display message timestamps and in other areas where time information needs to be displayed consistently.
- **Potential Usage**: Could be used in any context where formatted time display is needed, such as activity logs, notification timestamps, or event schedules.

## Props

- **date** (string): An ISO format date string that will be converted and displayed. Example: "2024-07-17T11:42:55.508653+00:00"

## Notes

- **Related Components**:
  - Typography - Used for consistent text styling
  - Uses luxon's DateTime for date parsing and formatting
  - Integrates with the application's TIME_FORMAT constants for consistent time display

## Example Usage

```javascript
import { Timestamp } from '@baseapp-frontend/design-system/web'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Timestamp date="2024-07-17T11:42:55.508653+00:00" />
}
export default MyComponent
```
