# **`@baseapp-frontend/design-system-mui`**

## **Overview**

This package defines our design system configuration (e.g. color pallete, typography, spacings, etc). It also shares reusable components that make up the design system as a whole.

## **What should be added here?**

In order to add any new feature inside the `design-system-mui` package, we need to ask ourselves some questions:

- Is that feature part of the design system configuration or is it a reusable design component?
